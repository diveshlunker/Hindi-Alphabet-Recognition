<br>
This project is built using pytorch to train and test the model.
<br>
The data set is taken from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset">archieve.ics.uci.edu</a>
<br>
Two EPOCHS are done which has given an accuracy of about 95% but can be increased with increasing number of EPOCHS.
